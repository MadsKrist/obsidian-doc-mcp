## Notes and Conventions

### Task Management
- Mark tasks as completed (✅) immediately after finishing
- Add newly discovered tasks to the appropriate milestone
- Break down large tasks into smaller, actionable items
- Add blockers (❌) with explanation of dependencies
- Use 🔄 for tasks that need review or validation

### Dependencies
- Tasks within a milestone can often be worked on in parallel
- Some cross-milestone dependencies exist (e.g., MCP tools need core infrastructure)
- Critical path items are marked with higher priority
- Blockers should be resolved before dependent tasks begin

### Testing Strategy
- Write tests concurrently with implementation, not afterward
- Each milestone should have passing tests before moving to the next
- Integration tests should be added as components are connected
- Performance tests should be written during Milestone 4

### Documentation
- Update CLAUDE.md as architecture decisions are made
- Keep PLANNING.md updated with any scope or timeline changes
- Document any significant technical decisions and rationale
- Update configuration examples as new options are added
